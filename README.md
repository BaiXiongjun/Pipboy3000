# Pipboy3000
This repository is my personal project, where I create a nice and usable GUI with looks and feels from the original PIP Boy Model 3000.
A proper readme and tutorial will be included once the project is finished

This code is neither efficient, nor does it look good, I know that very well, but I am still learning how to code with more efficiency. Code optimizations will be worked on after v1.0 had its full release.

<h1>REQUIREMENTS!!!</h1>
This program requires the following things:
1. Python 3.5+
2. Pygame 
3. Google API Python Client
4. Pyserial
